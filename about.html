            <h2>About Skittles</h2>
            <p><strong>Skittles are fruit-flavored candies produced by Mars, Incorporated. They have a colorful candy shell with a chewy interior.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Skittles are widely available in supermarkets, convenience stores, and online retailers. They are often used in baking and as toppings for desserts due to their vibrant colors and sweet taste. Skittles also have a strong presence in popular culture, appearing in commercials, movies, and even as a game where players try to sort and eat them by color.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>consist of hard sugar shells imprinted with the letter 'S', similar to M&M's which have the letter 'M'. The interior consists mainly of sugar, corn syrup, and hydrogenated palm kernel oil along with fruit juice, citric acid, and natural and artificial flavors.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>were first made commercially in 1974 by a British company. An animated television advertisement from that year bears the logo of the "Galaxy" company and is copyrighted by Jack Candies Ltd, a Mars distribution subsidiary. They were first introduced in North America in 1979 as an import confectionery. In 1982, domestic production of Skittles began in the United States.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The name of the candy, Skittles, comes from the sports game of the same name, named as such for the resemblance of the sweet to items used in the game.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>On March 2, 2009, Skittles launched a web-based marketing campaign where the official website became a small overlay with options to view different social media sites in the main area, including its official YouTube channel, a Facebook profile, and a Twitter account. The move was debated by people interested in social media.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>In 2009, the production of Skittles ceased using animal-derived gelatin, making them suitable for vegetarians, vegans and certain religious groups.</strong></p>
